    "title": "About Us",
    "subtitle": "WeApnea is the first platform dedicated to freediving events in Italy.\nThe community consists of instructors, coaches, competitive athletes and freediving enthusiasts, both indoor and outdoor.\nFor years, we lived with a fragmented and poorly connected reality: events scattered across forums, social groups and word of mouth. There was no single reference point to find training camps, workshops, courses, educational opportunities, trips and to give the discipline we love the proper visibility and accessibility.\nSo we thought it was time to create a Piazza (meeting place) for all of us freedivers.\nWe decided to offer the entire community a reference point for the usual questions: what’s out there? What’s happening?\nWeApnea was thus born with a clear goal: to make freediving more accessible, visible and connected.\nWhat can you find here?\nFreediving events and training sessions organized by certified instructors or freediving schools. Testimonials, ideas, networking and much more.\nWe are not a federation. We are not an educational organization. We are not just any social network.\nWe are a meeting point of experiences offered with transparency. An accelerator for those who want to live freediving as a journey of growth in the water and within themselves.\nAnd this is only the beginning...",
