    "subtitle": "WeApnea is the first platform dedicated to freediving events in Italy.\nThe community is made up of athletes, instructors, coaches, and enthusiasts of both indoor and outdoor freediving. For years, we lived in a fragmented reality — with events scattered across forums, social groups, and word of mouth. There was no single reference point to find stages, workshops, courses, training opportunities, trips, and to give our sport the visibility and inclusiveness it deserves.\nSo we decided to build that reference point ourselves.\n\nWeApnea was born with a clear goal: to make freediving more accessible, visible, and connected.\n\nWhat can you find here?\nFreediving events organized by certified instructors or schools\nTraining sessions shared by certified instructors\nCollaborations and benefits with brands and partners in the industry\nSpecial projects to help the community grow\n\nWe are not a federation. We are not just another social platform.\nWe are a meeting point — an accelerator for those who want to experience freediving as a journey of growth, both in the water and within themselves.\nAnd this is only the beginning",
